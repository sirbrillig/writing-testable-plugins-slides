### Writing testable plugins? Why?


These days the systems we are building are more and more complex. We press one button and get a result, but a million things happen behind the scenes.



If something goes wrong, you don't want to get one of those "Sorry, an error occurred!" messages.



You want to know exactly what happened. Good unit tests will give you that.


---



### What is a unit test?


Some code to test that one piece of a system operates as expected.


---



### Unit?
There are units of different sizes.

---



Database tests are a big unit. Function tests are a small unit.

Focus on the small.

---



Smaller systems are easier to understand.

---



Also, WordPress is a big unit!

It's nice to be able to test a plugin  
*without* WordPress.

---



You might not need unit tests!
(But it can't hurt!)

---



### What is a unit test? (pt. 2)


Unit tests check the *output* for a given *input*.
ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ™Œ


---



### What is testable code?

Code that makes it easy to test  
inputs and outputs in isolation.

---



Isolation is the hard part.

Most code has *dependencies* and *side effects*.

---



**Dependencies:**

this code's *input* is not just in the arguments.

---



To reduce dependencies:


1. Pass input to your functions rather than having your function fetch input themselves.


2. Put dependencies in variables that can be overridden.


---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
function update_post_status( $post_id ) {
	$post = get_post( $post_id );
	$post->post_status = 'publish';
	return wp_update_post( $post );
}

update_post_status( 123 );
```
ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
function update_post_status( $post ) {
	$post->post_status = 'publish';
	return wp_update_post( $post );
}

update_post_status( get_post( 123 ) );
```

---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
class MyPlugin {
	function update_post_status( $post_id ) {
		$updater = new Updater();
		$updater->update_post( $post_id );
	}
}
```
ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
class MyPlugin {
	public $updater;

	public function __construct( $updater = null ) {
		$this->updater = $updater ? $updater : new Updater();
	}

	public function update_post_status( $post_id ) {
		$this->updater->update_post( $post_id );
	}
}
```

---



Allowing dependencies to be overwritten is called "Dependency Injection".


Tests can isolate one part of code from another by replacing the dependencies.


---



**Side Effects:**

this code's *output* is not just in its return value.

---



To reduce side effects:

1. Have each function do just one thing.


2. Make more (specific) classes and functions.


---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
function update_post_data( $post ) {
	$post->post_status = 'publish';
	$post->post_excerpt = substr( $post->post_content, 0, 140 );
	return wp_update_post( $post );
}

update_post_data( get_post( 123 ) );
```
ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
function update_post_status( $post ) {
	$post->post_status = 'publish';
	return $post;
}

function update_post_excerpt( $post ) {
	$post->post_excerpt = substr( $post->post_content, 0, 140 );
	return $post;
}

$post = update_post_status( get_post( 123 ) );
$post = update_post_excerpt( $post );
wp_update_post( $post );
```

---



### Payton's Testable Precepts

---



**Precept 1:**
Always use classes, never global functions.

---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
function otherpages_add_shortcode() {
...
}
```

ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
class Otherpages {
	public function add_shortcode() {
	...
	}
}
```

---



One class to do one thing.

Don't be afraid of too many classes.

---



Where two classes interact, we can place a *mock*.

---



### Mocks (aka Stubs):

fake objects or functions that behave in a way we can control.

---



There are lots of ways to make mock objects and functions.  
but I'll suggest a library called `Spies`.

https://github.com/sirbrillig/spies

(I wrote it.)

---



Code getting input from a function dependency:
```php
function get_the_content( $id ) {
	$post = get_post( $id );
	return $post->post_content;
}
```
A test of that code with a mock function dependency:
```php
\Spies\mock_function( 'get_post' )->that_returns(
	(object) [ 'ID' => 123, 'post_content' => 'hello' ]
);
$result = get_the_content( 123 );
$this->assertEquals( 'hello', $result );
```

---



Code getting input from an object dependency:
```php
class MyPlugin {
	public $getter;

	public function __construct( $getter = null ) {
		$this->getter = $getter ? $getter : new Getter();
	}

	public function get_data_content() {
		$post = $this->getter->get_post();
		return $post->post_content;
	}
}
```
A test of that code with a mock object dependency:
```php
$getter = \Spies\mock_object();
$getter->add_method( 'get_post' )->that_returns(
	(object) [ 'ID' => 123, 'post_content' => 'hello' ]
);
$plugin = new MyPlugin( $getter );
$result = $plugin->get_data_content();
$this->assertEquals( 'hello', $result );
```

---



**Precept 2:**
Don't use static functions except as generators.

---



Why are static methods risky?

They cannot easily be mocked.

ðŸ˜›

---



Generators are a shortcut for object creation.

Static Generators are ok.

```php
class MyPlugin {
	public $getter;

	public function __construct( $getter ) {
		$this->getter = $getter;
	}

	public static function get_instance() {
		return new MyPlugin( new Getter() );
	}
}
```
They don't always need to be tested because we can test the object creation manually.

---



Static functions that have  
no dependencies and no side-effects are ok.

```php
class MyPlugin {
	public static function is_published_post( $post ) {
		return $post->post_status === 'publish';
	}
}
```
These can be tested without mocks.

---



**Precept 3:**
Use instance variables as constants.

---



Instance variables can be changed during runtime to produce different results for testing.

---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
define( 'DATA_DIR', '/data/dir' );

class MyPlugin {
	public function get_data() {
		return file_get_contents( DATA_DIR . '/data.txt' );
	}
}
```
ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
class MyPlugin {
	public $data_dir = '/data/dir';

	public function get_data() {
		return file_get_contents( $this->data_dir. '/data.txt' );
	}
}
```

---



**Precept 4:**
Use filters to pass data indirectly.

---



Better to pass data directly, but...

ðŸ—£  ðŸ‘¬ ðŸ‘¬ ðŸ‘¬ ðŸ‘¬

---



Sometimes you need to get data from one place and have something else pick it up later.

ðŸ—£  ðŸ‘¬ ðŸ•—  ðŸ‘¬ ðŸ‘¬

---



When passing data between functions indirectly, use a filter.

Filters can be mocked.

(Thanks WordPress!)

---



Here's an example of using a filter.
```php
function read_data( $post ) {
	add_filter( 'my_data', function() use ( &$post ) {
		return $post->post_content;
	} );
}

function return_data() {
	return apply_filters( 'my_data', $post->post_content );
}
```
You can write tests to be sure the filter is added and applied.
```php
mock_function( 'apply_filters' )->
	when_called->with( 'my_data' )->will_return( 'foobar' );
$this->assertEquals( 'foobar', return_data() );
```

---



**Precept 5:**
Use verbs in all function names.

---



Isn't that just style?

ðŸ¤”

---



A function name should tell you what inputs and outputs are expected.


Some great verbs are

`get`, `is`, `update`, `create`, `remove`.


---



Example: a shortcode handler

`add_shortcode( 'otherpages', ... );`

ðŸ‘†

- `my_shortcode` doesn't really say what it does.
- `process_my_shortcode` is better, but still ambiguous about what the function returns.
- `get_markup_from_shortcode` tells us what the input and output will be.

---



If a function does too many things to name, consider splitting it.

---



**Precept 6:**
Keep functions below eight lines  
and indentation below four levels.

---



Shorter functions are easier to understand.

---



Use `array_map`, `array_filter`, `array_reduce`, etc. instead of `while`, `for`, and `foreach`.

---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
function get_recent_post_titles( $posts ) {
	$matching = [];
	foreach( $posts as $post ) {
		if ( time()- strtotime( $post->post_date_gmt ) < 86400 ) {
			$matching[] = $post->post_title;
		}
	}
	return $matching;
}
```
ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
function get_recent_post_titles( $posts ) {
	$posts = array_filter( $posts, 'is_post_recent' );
	return array_map( 'get_post_title', $posts );
}

function is_post_recent( $post ) {
	return ( time()- strtotime( $post->post_date_gmt ) < 86400 );
}

function get_post_title( $post ) {
	return $post->post_title;
}
```

---



**Precept 7:**
Consider all possible inputs and outputs.

---



Check for errors from external functions.

---



When testing (or in real life!), your data might be missing or incomplete.

---



ðŸš« Nope.
```php
function get_post_title( $post_id ) {
	$post = get_post( $post_id );
	return $post->post_title;
}
```
ðŸŽ‰ Yay!
```php
function get_post_title( $post_id ) {
	$post = get_post( $post_id );
	if ( $post ) {
		return $post->post_title;
	}
	return '';
}
```

---



**Precept 8:**
Whenever possible, write tests first.

---



Tested code gives us confidence.

It will work the way we expect.


(We have defined our expectations.)


It can be refactored safely.


---



**Precept 9:**
Don't test the code from other libraries,

but test the inputs and outputs.

---



We can assume that WordPress works.

(Otherwise we have bigger problems!)


But we should make sure that we are using WordPress the way we expect.


---



We can test the inputs to external functions with *spies*.

---



### What is a Spy?
An object that behaves like a function and which we can query to learn how it was called.

---



(do a thing that calls a method)

"Hey spy! Did that method get called the way we expected?"

---



Here we use a spy to make sure a shortcode is added correctly.
```php
function add_my_shortcode() {
	add_shortcode(
		'otherpages',
		'get_markup_from_shortcode'
	);
}
```
```php
$spy = \Spies\get_spy_for( 'add_shortcode' );

add_my_shortcode();

$this->assertTrue(
	$spy->was_called_with(
		'otherpages',
		\Spies\any()
	);
);
```

---



**Precept 10:**
Write only one assertion per test.

---



A unit is one thing.

A unit test should test that one thing.

One function's *one input* and *one output*.

---



Can a function have more than one input or output?

Write more than one test.

---



> "Unit tests isolate failures. Even if a product contains millions of lines of code, if a unit test fails, you only need to search that small unit under test to find the bug."


https://googletesting.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html


---



Code is hard. You can't predict all possible situations.

When you find a bug, write a test that causes it, and then fix the bug so the test passes.


---



### What is a unit test? (pt. 3)


Confidence, safety, readability.


An investment in the future of your code.
